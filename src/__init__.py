""" The Humble Bundle API

###############
Humble Bundle API
###############

A library for interacting with the Humble Bundle data cache.
This is the data cache that Humble Bundle loads client-side when you navigate your products.
The goal of this library is to facilitate other tools to be built around the Humble Bundle store, since the web-based index can be limiting.
Specifically, I built this library with the intention of making a Calibre plugin for fetching ebooks remotely.
